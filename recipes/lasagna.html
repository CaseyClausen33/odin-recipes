	<h2>Description</h2>
		<p1>Lasagna is a rich and hearty Italian dish made by layering sheets of tender pasta with flavorful sauces, cheeses, and fillings. Traditionally, it features layers of creamy ricotta or béchamel sauce, tangy tomato or meat sauce, and generous amounts of melted mozzarella and Parmesan. Each layer soaks up the flavors of the next, creating a comforting blend of textures — from the soft pasta to the gooey cheese and savory meat. When baked, the top becomes golden and slightly crisp, sealing in the warmth and aroma of the ingredients. Served hot, lasagna is both satisfying and indulgent, making it a classic centerpiece for family dinners and gatherings.</p1>
